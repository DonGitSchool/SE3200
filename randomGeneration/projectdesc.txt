Project 2: Random Generation
Requirements
Using JavaScript, create a simple client web application that demonstrates the following:

DOM querying: query elements from the DOM as necessary to build a functioning application.

DOM manipulation: modify DOM elements as necessary to evolve both the content and style of page elements.

DOM insertion: create new DOM elements and insert them into the DOM to generate new page content.

Events: use events, such as onclick, to make the application functional and interactive.

Randomness: integrate an element of randomness into the application, because randomness is funness.

Data: integrate some representation of data into the application, using JavaScript arrays and objects to store it.

Ajax: use the Fetch APILinks to an external site.  to retrieve data from a server and represent it within the application.

Your application should exceed the complexity of the class example, both functionally and visually, and your application should differ significantly from the class example (a Magic 8-Ball).

Make your application look professional and presentable. Use valid HTML and CSS to structure and style your application.

No third-party JavaScript or CSS libraries or frameworks may be used without prior instructor permission.
